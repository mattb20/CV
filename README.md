Hard working, yet flexible software developer currently looking for my first role in the industry. I was formerly a Secondary school teacher. I currently love programming in Ruby, but am also capable of programming in JavaScript, and will be able to pick up other languages and technologies quickly.

## Skills

#### Communication

During my time at university I spent a semester at Brooke House Sixth Form College assisting the teaching staff
inside and outside of A Level Mathematics lessons. This involved spending an afternoon at the college each
week. My tasks were to communicate with the class teacher to ensure I knew which topics were being covered
on the afternoon I was at the college, so I could ensure my subject knowledge was top quality and explanations
were prepared in advance ready for students. I also took small groups of students out of lessons to have 
independent, more focused sessions studying topics they were struggling with. While at the college I had to write a log book
each week detailing what I had learnt about how Mathematics is taught in school. I also did a special project
which involved coaching students about exam technique. After my time had finished I wrote a report
summarising all that I had learnt which was marked by my university tutors, and gave a presentation to my fellow undergraduate students explaining my project and the skills I'd developed at my time at the college.

On graduating from Queen Mary, I began a PGCE at King's College London in Secondary Mathematics.
Here, I had the opportunity to work with tutors who were engaged in active research in Mathematics education.
This built on my already excellent understanding of Mathematics and helped me to become fully confident and
comfortable communicating about Mathematics to groups of students in a classroom environment. I was
required to plan and deliver extremely high-quality Mathematics lessons at two Secondary schools in Inner
London, one of them oustanding. I also communicated with parents about a wide range of issues involving their childs progress at school.

From my experience in teaching, I was required to communicate with a wide range of people (students, fellow colleagues, parents) on a wide range of topics. I particularly loved communicating abstract and complex mathematical ideas to my students in a way that allowed them to feel confident in applying these ideas. I have now added to my communication skills at Makers by working in a team on projects and regularly pair programming.

#### Innovative and forward thinking

During my A levels, I worked for an educational start up, NumberFit, as a teacher/instructor and resource creator. My colleagues and I at NumberFit realised that mathematics education, particularly at primary school, was leaving many children feeling alienated and lost, very early on in their educational journey. NumberFit introduced a unique idea of incorporating games and physical activity into a maths lesson, for a term. This meant that children were constantly having fun whilst learning, and attainment after the term had finished in school tests had increased for the participating children. 

## Education
Makers Academy (19/3/2018 to 9/7/2018)

- Curious and passionate about code. I regularly read books about code, even if they aren't specific to what I am currently studying. I am currently reading the Rails 4 way. I also attended a hackathon during my time at Makers as I was keen to get as much experience of coding as possible. I also attended workshops after the day had finished, such as one on cryptography.
In addition to this, I also pursued some personal projects outside of time spent at Makers, including a programme that scrapes data from a football league table in order to conduct stastical analysis on it.
- Fast, independent learner - learnt both Ruby and Javascript over the course of three months.
- Great collaborator - completed projects as part of a team at my time at Makers including producing a clone of Instagram and AirBnB.

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara
- Postgres, MongoDB
- Node, React


Kings College London - PGCE Secondary Mathematics
- Wrote academic research paper into how students develop understandings of linear equations
- Wrote academic research paper investigating the recent introduction of the Progress 8 measure relating to school attainment
Queen Mary, University of London - BSc Mathematics

## Interests

I enjoy long distance running and have tied this to my desire to make a positive impact on the world around me a better place raising money for charity through my competition in marathons. I played football regularly at university, I also play badminton and have played for my County, competing in regional and national tournaments while I was at school. I enjoy swimming and have achieved swimming awards for distance and life saving. I enjoy reading The Econmist magazine which allows
Aside from that I just really enjoy learning new things and am always looking for ways to deepen my experiences, for example through travelling. I recently travelled solo around Japan.
