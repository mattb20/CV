Hard working, yet flexible software developer currently looking for my first role in the industry. I was formerly a secondary school teacher. I love programming in Ruby, JavaScript, and can learn and apply new languages and technologies quickly.

## Skills

#### Communication
My university education and first teaching role have allowed me to become fully confident and comfortable communicating about Mathematics to a wide range of students in a classroom environment. I have been required to plan and deliver extremely high quality Mathematics lessons at three different secondary schools in Inner London, one of them outstanding. I have also communicated with parents about a wide range of issues involving their child's progress at school. During my PGCE, I also completed two academic research papers. One being a study into how secondary school students developed an understanding of equations. A second one was assessing and investigating the recently introduced Progress 8 measure of schools attainment. Completion of these has given me strong written communication skills to combine with my well developed verbal communication skills.

From my experience in teaching, I particularly loved communicating abstract and complex mathematical ideas to my students in a way that allowed them to feel confident in applying these ideas, regardless of their current attainment level. Time at Makers Academy developing software projects in a group setting has equipped me with strong verbal communication skills in the context of software development.

#### Problem solving
Solving countless mathematical problems over my A level and degree qualifications have taught me to formulate a problem in precise terms, identifying key issues. In addition I have learnt to break large problems down by looking at special cases or sub-problems. For example if you are working on a large proof, you need to split it up into small steps, each one leading to the next. After solving the problem in question I also have a great deal of experience in presenting the solutions clearly and logically, making any assumptions I have made explicit.

#### Innovative and forward thinking

During my A levels, I worked for an educational start up, NumberFit, as a teacher/instructor and resource creator. My colleagues and I at NumberFit realised that mathematics education, particularly at primary school, was leaving many children feeling alienated and lost, very early on in their educational journey. NumberFit introduced a unique idea of incorporating games and physical activity into a maths lesson, for a term. This meant that children were constantly having fun whilst learning, and attainment after the term had finished in school tests had increased for the participating children. 

## Education
Makers Academy (19/3/2018 to 9/6/2018)

- Curious and passionate about code. I regularly read books about code, even if they aren't specific to what I am currently studying. I am currently reading Java, The Complete Edition. I also attended a hackathon during my time at Makers as I was keen to get as much experience of coding as possible. I also attended workshops after the day had finished, such as one on cryptography.
In addition to this, I also pursued some personal projects outside of time spent at Makers, including a programme that scrapes data from a football league table in order to conduct statistical analysis on it.
- Fast, independent learner - learnt both Ruby and JavaScript over the course of three months.
- Great collaborator - completed projects as part of a team at my time at Makers including producing a clone of Instagram and AirBnB.

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara
- Postgres, MongoDB
- Node, React, Express

## Interests

I enjoy long distance running and have tied this to my desire to make a positive impact on the world around me a better place raising money for charity through my competition in marathons. I played football regularly at university, I also play badminton and have played for my County, competing in regional and national tournaments while I was at school. I enjoy swimming and have achieved swimming awards for distance and life saving. I enjoy reading The Econmist magazine which allows me to keep up to date with events in a wide range of industries. Aside from that, I just really enjoy learning new things and am always looking for ways to deepen my experiences, for example through travelling. I recently travelled solo around Japan.
