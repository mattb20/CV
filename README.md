Hard working, yet flexible software developer currently looking for my first role in the industry. I was formerly a secondary school teacher.

## Skills

#### Communication

From my experience in teaching, I was required to communicate with a wide range of people (students, fellow colleagues, parents) on a wide range of topics. I have now added to my communication skills at Makers by working in a team on projects and regularly pair programming.

## Education
Makers Academy (19/3/2018 to 9/7/2018)

- Curious and passionate about code. I regularly read books about code, even if they aren't specific to what I am currently studying. I am currently reading the Rails 4 way. I also attended a hackathon during my time at Makers as I was keen to get as much experience of coding as possible. I also attended workshops after the day had finished, such as one on cryptography.
- Fast, independent learner - learnt both Ruby and Javascript over the course of three months.
- Great collaborator - completed projects as part of a team at my time at Makers including producing a clone of Instagram and AirBnB.
