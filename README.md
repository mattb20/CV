Hard working, yet flexible software developer currently looking for my first role in the industry. I was formerly a Secondary school teacher. I currently love programming in Ruby, but am also capable of programming in JavaScript, and will be able to pick up other languages and technologies quickly.

## Skills

#### Communication
I spent around five or six hours during my last semester at university at BSix College in Clapton. My tasks were to communicate with the class teacher to ensure I knew which topics were being covered
on the afternoon I was at the college, to ensure my subject knowledge was top quality and explanations
were prepared in advance ready for students. I also took small groups of students out of lessons to have 
independent, more focused sessions on topics they were struggling with. I had to write a log book each week detailing what I had learnt about how Mathematics is taught in school. I did a special project which involved coaching students about exam technique, which students found extremely useful. Upon finishing I wrote a report summarising all my learnings, gave a presentation to my fellow undergraduate students explaining my project and the skills I'd developed at my time at the college and wrote a report based on my log book entries.

On graduating from Queen Mary, I began a PGCE at King's College London in Secondary Mathematics.
Here, I had the opportunity to work with tutors who were engaged in active research in Mathematics education.
This allowed to become fully confident and comfortable communicating about Mathematics to a wide range of students in a classroom environment. I was required to plan and deliver extremely high-quality Mathematics lessons at two Secondary schools in Inner London, one of them oustanding. I also communicated with parents about a wide range of issues involving their childs progress at school. During my PGCE I also completed two academic research papers. A study into how secondary school students developed an understanding of equations and one assessing and investing the recently introduced Progress 8 measure of schools attainment.

From my experience in teaching, I particularly loved communicating abstract and complex mathematical ideas to my students in a way that allowed them to feel confident in applying these ideas, regardless of their current attainment level. I have now added to my communication skills at Makers by working in a team on projects and regularly pair programming.

#### Problem solving
Solving countless mathematical problems over my A level and degree qualifications have taught me to formulate a problem in precise terms, identifying key issues. In addition I have learnt to large problems down by looking at special cases or sub-problems, for example if you are working on a large proof, you need to split it down into small steps. After solving the problem in question I also have lots of experience in presenting the solutions clearly and logically,making any assumptions I have made explicit.

#### Innovative and forward thinking

During my A levels, I worked for an educational start up, NumberFit, as a teacher/instructor and resource creator. My colleagues and I at NumberFit realised that mathematics education, particularly at primary school, was leaving many children feeling alienated and lost, very early on in their educational journey. NumberFit introduced a unique idea of incorporating games and physical activity into a maths lesson, for a term. This meant that children were constantly having fun whilst learning, and attainment after the term had finished in school tests had increased for the participating children. 

## Education
Makers Academy (19/3/2018 to 9/7/2018)

- Curious and passionate about code. I regularly read books about code, even if they aren't specific to what I am currently studying. I am currently reading the Rails 4 way. I also attended a hackathon during my time at Makers as I was keen to get as much experience of coding as possible. I also attended workshops after the day had finished, such as one on cryptography.
In addition to this, I also pursued some personal projects outside of time spent at Makers, including a programme that scrapes data from a football league table in order to conduct stastical analysis on it.
- Fast, independent learner - learnt both Ruby and Javascript over the course of three months.
- Great collaborator - completed projects as part of a team at my time at Makers including producing a clone of Instagram and AirBnB.

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara
- Postgres, MongoDB
- Node, React

## Interests

I enjoy long distance running and have tied this to my desire to make a positive impact on the world around me a better place raising money for charity through my competition in marathons. I played football regularly at university, I also play badminton and have played for my County, competing in regional and national tournaments while I was at school. I enjoy swimming and have achieved swimming awards for distance and life saving. I enjoy reading The Econmist magazine which allows
Aside from that I just really enjoy learning new things and am always looking for ways to deepen my experiences, for example through travelling. I recently travelled solo around Japan.
